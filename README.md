Lab 1: 
Random Equation Generator: 
      
      - Program that generates a series of random equations and prompts the user to answer each equation generated.     
      - Program keeps track of each equation and whether or not the equation was answered correctly.
      - If an equation is generated that has already been presented to the user, the program checks if previously 
        answered correctly. 
        If it was answered correctly, the equation should be ignored and a new equation generated. If the equation 
        was not answered correctly, the user should be prompted to answer it.
